React -> Everything is JS (Logic + HTML)


Node JS? => Environment to run JS
npm => Node Package Manager


React JS JSX <CONVERT> Vanila JS -> Babel (Transpiler)
Angular <CONVERT> Vanilla JS
Vue JS <CONVERT> Vanilla JS

React Functional Component : IF a function in ReactJS is returning HTML, then we can not call it like MyFn() rather we call it like <MyFn></MyFn>
sum() => Normal fn returning any data type of js
<Sum> </Sum> => React fn returning html

Boiler Plate => Ready made configured app for any Framework or library.

Create React App
Vite

const App = () => {} // App.js
root.render(<App />) // index.js



Create React App

npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app <project_name>
cd <project_name>
npm start

OR

npx create-react-app <project_name>
cd <project_name>

Export & Imports are required to use the components from a different file

1. Export -> The component to be used (At the end of the file)
2. Import -> The component to be used (At the starting of the file)

2 Types of exports
Default export -> When you have only 1 component / item to export from a file.
Named export -> When you have multiple components / items to exports from a file.

2 Types of CSS

Modular CSS => Specific to a component / Screen
Global CSS => Common CSS for the project

largeTxt -> 30px (Content.module.css)
largeTxt -> 80px (Copyright)


Props : Dynamic data (arguments) passed to a component in the form of object
forEach and for() are not allowed inside jsx in react

19-09-2024
Render => To show something
Re-render => To show something again with updated values

 let [variableName, setterFunction] = useState(initial-value)

State => Manages the internal data of the component
Props => Are received form outside the component

Hooks => Special functions in react written to perform the updates or any side effect

useState
useEffect
useLayout
useCallback
useMemo
etc

20-09-2024
Conditional Rendering

Lifting up the state => Passing the data from child to parent, we pass a fn from parent to child as a prop, and the fn is called inside the child

24-09-2024
useEffect : hook to handle side effects

useEffect can be used in cases, where i want the operation to happen only 1 time in a component throughtout the lifecycle
Syntax : 
useEffect(callbackFn, dependencyArray)

If the values in the dependency array changes, it will run the callbackFn inside useEffect hook.

Initial Render (Mounting Phase)
1. setTimeout => 3 sec => setter fn call => Re-render

Updation Phase
2. setTimeout =>  3 sec => setter fn call => Re-render
2. setTimeout =>  3 sec => setter fn call => Re-render
2. setTimeout =>  3 sec => setter fn call => Re-render
2. setTimeout =>  3 sec => setter fn call => Re-render
2. setTimeout =>  3 sec => setter fn call => Re-render
2. setTimeout =>  3 sec => setter fn call => Re-render
2. setTimeout =>  3 sec => setter fn call => Re-render

API (Application Programming Interface) => Connector / bridge between 2 parties

Front End (Client)
Back End (Server)

Back End (Server)
Back End (Server)

Data Type : JSON

Methods of APIs
1. GET => Get the data from server (Get the list of products, social media feeds, user profile etc)
2. POST => Send some data to the server (Submitting enquriy form, User Registration / Signup, Creating a new post / blog, Placing an order)

Request -> Response

27-09-2024

Pre requisits To call an API
1. API URL / Link  (API End Point)
2. HTTP Method (GET / POST etc)
3. Request Body : {}

API => HTTP Request
2 Parts
    1. Header
    2. Body

Hosting / Deploying => Putting the webapp on internet for use

1 Babel
2 Webpack (Merge and minify)


2 Options to deploy
1. Manually build the code and upload the build on hosting platform
2. Find a hosting website that builds the code for us and upload it


// Fin the index with the help of id
array.splice(<index of item to perfrom operation>, <no of items to delete>, ...<item to insert>)

    
<button onClick={() => onDelete(uniqueId)}>Delete</button>


showMessage("Item addes successfully")

2 Types of routing
1. Server side routing => Server renders every page (The page loads)
2. Client side routing => Client already have all the pages with them and they just load it on screen ( The page doesn't loads)


Dynamic Route

/geekster-in/useRef-Callback-a34bcc59724142f2ab48172aeed1c4ab

<base route>/<dynamic-route>


/hotels/hotel-details/hotelId=asldfjas


/hotel/hotel-details/:hotelId
/hotel/hotel-details/1
/hotel/hotel-details/2
/hotel/hotel-details/3
/hotel/hotel-details/5465



2 Screens
1. Listing : Call the listing api, run map, create links dynamically
2. Details : Call the details api by passing the id of the item

// Local Pagination

const arr = []; //100 items

0-20 => Page 1
21-40 => Page 2
...

arr.slice(21,40).map(() => {})


API Based Pagination
axios.get("ab.com/data?pageNo=2")
arr.map(() => {})

const userObj = arr.find(data => data.addhaarNo === aadhaarNo)
if(userObj) {
    // Show data
}

Process to 
1. Create a context (createContext()) - Done
2. Attach / Provide the context to the app tree (<Context.Provider></Context.Provider>) - Done
3. Use the context to get the data anywhere in the tree (useContext(Context)) - Done


Trello Clone :
1. ContextAPI
2. UseReducer
3. Drag & Drop Functionality

context (Built In)

User Journey / User Flow

1st Time journey : Login/Signup -> List Blog Screen
Repeating user journey : List Blog Screen


Login/Signup -> List Blog Screen -> Logout (Click on Logout) -> Login/Signup
Login/Signup -> List Blog Screen (Click on Create Blog Link) -> Create Blog (Successful blog creation) -> List Blog Screen 

Protected Routes => Availalbe to an authenticated user only (Blog list, Blog Create)
Public Routes => Available to everyone without authentication / authorization (Login)


Data Saving
1. Temporary : Variables
2. Permanent : Database


Database (Firebase console)
    Collection (Code -> collection())
        Store Data (Document)

C => Create Blog
R => List Blog
U => Edit Blog
D => Delete Blog

Optimization
Preventing re-renders when the prop doen't changes
1. Strings, Number, Booleans => memo(<CHILD_COMPONENT />)
2. Functions => useCallback(function to be passed as prop)
3. Array => 


useMemo => It calls the wrapped fn and caches its return value
dependency array determines how many times the function should be called
[] => Run only once and cache the value
[variable] => Run every time the variable changes



useCallback => Caches/Memoize the function definition
useMemo => Caches/Memoize the function's return value
memo =>  HOC (Interview Question)

Context API + useReducer => Redux

3 Components of redux

Actions : Actions are plain objects which contains 2 k-v pair (type : ADD_ITEM, REMOVE_ITEM, payload: DATA TO BE USED WHILE PERFORMING THE OPERATION)
Reducers : Pure functions which contains business logic and used to update the state / store
State / Store : A common storage area for whole application (js object)

Slice => Actions + Reducer

const store = {
    pendingtodolist: [],
    completedtodolist: [],
    .....
}

Action => 
{
    type: "MOVE_ITEM_TO_COMPLETED",
    payload: {
        todoid: 1
    }
}

Reducer =>

    const reducer = (state,action) => {
        switch(action.type) {
            case "MOVE_ITEM_TO_COMPLETED":
                return {
                    ...state,
                    completedtodolist: [...state.todo,...]
                }
            case "REMOVE_FROM_COMPLETED":
                return {
                    ...state,

                }
        }
    }

ReactJS Lifecycle 
Phases of lifecycle : Mounting, updating, unmounting


useEffect(() => {},[]); => componentDidMount()
useEffect(() => {}); => componentDidUpdate()
useEffect(() => { return () => {} },[]) => componentWillUnmount()



class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      counter: 0,
      values: []
    }
    console.log("Constructor");
  }

  // React methods : User defined, Pre- defined method

  onBtnClick = () => {
    this.setState({
      counter: this.state.counter + 1
    })
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    console.log("Component will unmount")
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    console.log("Component did update")
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    // API Calls on load etc
    console.log("Component did mount")
  }

  render() {
    // console.log(this.props)
    console.log("Render")
    return (
      <>
        <h1>React class based component</h1>
        {
          this.state.counter
        }
        <button onClick={this.onBtnClick}>Increase Counter</button>
      </>
    )
